<p> History <br>
<p>Tinny’s Store began with a simple dream in 2018—a plan to build a small business that <br>would help support the family and serve the people in the community.<br> Through hard work, determination,<br> and constant prayer, this dream slowly turned into reality.<br>
<p>The store was founded by Hilda Gumera,<br> whose dedication and effort became the heart of the business.<br> With limited resources but strong faith, she started Tinny’s Store<br> and managed it with patience and persistence.<br> Over the years, the store grew little by little, <br>becoming a trusted place where residents could buy everyday goods.<br>
<p>From 2018 up to now, Tinny’s Store<br> continues to operate and serve the community. Its growth<br> stands as a reminder that with effort and prayer, <br>even small beginnings can lead to lasting success.<br>

As the owner of Tinny’s Store, Hilda Gumera faced countless challenges from the very beginning. Starting with limited resources, she had to balance her time between managing the store, caring for her family, and handling daily responsibilities. Competition from other stores made it difficult to keep a steady income, and there were times when sales went up and down. Despite these struggles, Hilda continued to work patiently, waking up early, praying for strength, and pushing forward even during tough days. Her journey shows that behind every small business is a story of sacrifice, resilience, and a strong will to provide a better future for her family.
